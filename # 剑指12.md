给定一个m x n 二维字符网格board 和一个字符串单词word 。如果word 存在于网格中，返回 true ；否则，返回 false 。

单词必须按照字母顺序，通过相邻的单元格内的字母构成，其中“相邻”单元格是那些水平相邻或垂直相邻的单元格。同一个单元格内的字母不允许被重复使用。

### solution dfs
depth-first search
implement traversal by dfs, and do prunings for impossible situations to cut down time 
detailed thoughts see the comments in code
```python
class Solution:
    def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
        # (x,y)->the cordinate of the matrix, k->the index of the word, word[k]->the character in position k
        def dfs(x: int, y: int, k: int):
            # the end condition: out of border or not match word
            if not 0 <= x < len(board) or not 0 <= y < len(board[0]) or board[x][y] != word[k]:
                return False
            # the end condition, match completed
            if k == len(word) -1:
                return True
            # now board[x][y] == word[k], then call dfs to find and match word[k+1]
            # because (x,y) has been reached in the current round, so should flag it as a different value, indicating it has been used
            board[x][y] = "!"
            # dfs to search all possible directions
            exi = dfs(x+1, y, k+1) or dfs(x-1, y, k+1) or dfs(x, y+1, k+1) or dfs(x, y-1, k+1)
            # restore its original value
            board[x][y] = word[k]
            return exi
        # traversal, begin at any point of the matrix
        for i in range (0, len(board)):
            for j in range(0, len(board[0])):
                if dfs(i, j, 0):
                    return True
        # traverse all possibilities and find none
        return False
```
#### comlexity
$matrix -> M * N$
$K$ -> the length of word
##### time comlexity
for each step, dfs has three possible searching directions: right, left, up and down (one is where coms from so remained 3 possible direcitons), so the search possibilities for a k-length string is $3^K$. there are $M*N$ possible beginning points, so the time complexity is $O(3^KMN)$
##### space comlexity
the depth of recursion is at most $K$, because for each character in word call a dfs, so the size of stack for recursion is at most $O(K)$
