#### solution 1
use recursion
preoder : [root, left, right]
inorder : [left, root, right]
- we can know root node from preorder (the first one)
- we can know left-tree and right-tree by inorder
- repeat and recurse this process
- when cannot construct a tree, end the recursion 

3 elements about recursion:
- the end condition -> the tree doesn't exist
- what to do in each recursion -> find the root and then construct the left-tree and right-tree, connect them to the root
- the return value -> the root of the tree (in each recursion)
  
```python
class Solution:
    # Definition for a binary tree node.
    # class TreeNode:
    #     def __init__(self, x):
    #         self.val = x
    #         self.left = None
    #         self.right = None

    def buildTree(self, preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
        # define a recursion function to reconstruct the tree, return the root of the constructed tree
        # all of the four input are indexs in according preorder or inorder list
        def recurse_build_tree (preorder_left: int, preorder_right: int, inorder_left: int, inorder_right: int) -> TreeNode:
            # end condition, when the tree does not exist
            if preorder_left > preorder_right:
                return None
            # find the preorder_root(index), it is the first in preorder 
            preorder_root = preorder_left
            # construct the root node
            root  = TreeNode(preorder[preorder_root])
            # split the left-tree and right-tree
            # find the root in inorder
            inorder_root = inorder.index(preorder[preorder_root])
            # the size of left subtree
            left_tree_len = inorder_root - inorder_left + 1
            right_tree_len = len(inorder) - inorder_root
            # use recursion to construct the left_subtree, connect it to root
            root.left = recurse_build_tree (preorder_left + 1, preorder_left + left_tree_len, inorder_left, inorder_left + left_tree_len)
            # use recursion to construct the right_subtree, connect it to root
            root.right = recurse_build_tree (preorder_left + left_tree_len + 1, preorder_right, inorder_root + 1, inorder_right)
            return root
    
        n = len(preorder)
        # call recursion in the main function
        recurse_build_tree(0, n-1, 0, n-1)
